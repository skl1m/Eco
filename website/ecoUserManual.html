	<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>
			For our CECS senior project we wanted to create something to help teach people about sustainable living. According to the Japanese Plastic Waste Management Institute, at 77 percent, Japan's recycling rate is over 3 times as much as the rate in the US (20 percent). Japanese recycling culture is something that is instilled from a young age. However, in the US, the country that creates the most waste in the world, a major issue with sustainability is a lack of education. In order to educate people, we wanted to create an Amazon Alexa skill that will provide information to users about how to reduce their global impact. We hope to educate others and spread the idea that many small incremental changes will one day lead to great progress.
		</p>

	<h2>What is Eco?</h2>
		<p>Eco is an Amazon voice service - also known as an <b>Alexa skill</b>.  Alexa provides capabilities, or skills, that enable users to create a more personalized experience. Through Eco, users can gain access to <b>sustainability information</b> on their Alexa devices.
		</p>

		<p>An Alexa skill can only be used by <b>Alexa compatible devices</b>. Users can gain access to Eco by enabling the skill via Amazon’s website on the Amazon skills page.  
		</p>

	<h2>What can Eco do?</h2>
		<p>For some people, there may be confusion about how easy it can be to live more sustainably, and how little changes we make in our everyday life can create a huge impact. With Eco, users will be able to ask Alexa questions such as, “Alexa, how can I be more sustainable at home,” and “What can I put in my recycling bin?” The answers will vary depending on the question, and questions can have multiple responses to ensure that the user is engaged. With our system, we hope to start by educating individuals with hopes that they’ll continue to educate others around them. 
		</p>

	<h2>Where do I start?</h2>

		<p>Users can enable Eco from their Alexa device or through the Amazon website.</p>

		<h2>To get Eco on your Alexa device:</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Turn on your Alexa device.</li>
					<li>Say "Alexa, enable Eco."</li>
				</ol>
			</p>


		<h2>From the Amazon website:</h2>
			<p>You can search for and enable skills in the Alexa app and from the Alexa Skills store on the Amazon website. If you know the exact name of the skill you want, you can say, "Enable Jeopardy skill." Skill availability varies by country.
			</p>


		<h2>To enable Alexa skills:</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the menu, and select <b>Skills</b>. Or, go to the Alexa Skills store on the Amazon website: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/skills">https://www.amazon.com/skills</a>.</li>
					<li>When you find a skill you want to use, select it to open the skill detail page.</li>
					<li>Select the <b>Enable Skill</b> option, or ask Alexa to open the skill.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

	<h2>How to Use Eco</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Turn on your Alexa device.</li>
			<li>Say "Alexa, start EcoPal."</li>
			<li>You now have several options:
			<br>3.1 Ask Eco for a random sustainability tip.
			<br>3.2 Ask Eco how to be sustainable at home, work, or school.
			<br>3.3 Ask Eco how to recycle a certain material.
			<li>When you're done, you can say "Alexa, stop" to stop the current action or "Alexa, quit" to exit the current skill. </li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
