# Eco Pal
Hello friends! Eco Pal is an Alexa skill. The Eco Pal system is meant to give individuals a unique and interactive way of learning about sustainabiity from the comfort of your home or whever you may have an Alexa compatible device. Eco Pal came to be because our team was interested in developing an Alexa skill and our professor is a big advocate of sustainability. Consequently, we married the two interests to create Eco Pal. 
## Where can you find the documentation?

## What our system currently does?
* Gives random sustainability tips
* Gives sustainability tips based on whether the user specifies home, work, or school.
* Gives information regarding whether certain items are recycable, compostable, or trashed. 
We currently have 3 different use cases for our skill. Within these use cases, there's still some tidying up to do. 
## To Do List
* Add comments to current code
* Make sure tips are only given when asked
* Add ability to retrieve closest recycling centers, or places that accepts compost, or any locations relevant to sustainability
* Random facts related to climate change
* Consider Dr. Penzenstadler's recommendation about how facts should be releveant to your current weather. For instance one of our tips was to plant herbs in your window sill and Dr. Penzenstadler thinks that wouldn't be useful to someone who lives in a primarily freezing climate.
