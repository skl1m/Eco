# Eco Pal
Hello friends! Eco Pal is an Alexa skill. The Eco Pal system is meant to give individuals a unique and interactive way of learning about sustainabiity from the comfort of your home or whever you may have an Alexa compatible device. Eco Pal came to be because our team was interested in developing an Alexa skill and our professor is a big advocate of sustainability. Consequently, we married the two interests to create Eco Pal.
